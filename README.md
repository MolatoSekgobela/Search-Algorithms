Linear Search vs Binary Search

We Take a look at the implementation of Linear and binary search algorithms and a litle bit of data structures

Find two files:

Linear_search.py
Binary_search.py

Take note Linear search doesnt not require the data structure to be sorted while for binary we need to soort our data
structure.

for this example we used two identical arrays and we guess and search the same target. we keep count of the number of
guesses it takes for each algorithm to get a result.
